  <p>
    Tablature notation is a kind of notation based on the gesture. In western music history, tablature notation is a
    substantial part of plucked, bowed, and keyboard instruments from around the early 16<sup>th</sup> to the late
    18<sup>th</sup>
    century which provides the action a player must take rather than a description of the sounds (de Valk et al. 2020).
    In Eastern music history, especially in the East Asia sphere, tablature notation systems, such as Guqin tablature
    for instrument Guqin in China and rotsure tablature for instrument Shakuhachi in Japan, have a long history and
    continues to the present day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike the number-based western tablature, Eastern tablature systems are based on characters that contain full
    gestures of the performer and don't contain prescriptive duration and rhythm, as shown in Figure 1. However,
    existing score editors only support the number-based tablature and don't support editing the character tablature.
    Furthermore, this kind of notation system lets the performers be the core of the performance who has more space to
    interpret, and gestures themself play a more important part in the performance (Chen 2020). Back to the present,
    many newly invented digital musical instruments composers are also sharing the same values of performance with
    eastern tablature and looking for a gesture-based editor. In this way, we decide to start from the eastern tablature
    system, create an open-source gesture-based tablature score editor, contribute to the revival of the traditional
    notation system, and open to the future diverse gesture-based notation system.

    Our project is aimed to develop a web-based tablature editor. The editor will focus on gesture-based notation
    systems in various cultures and times. The early stage of the project will mainly focus on realizing the
    character-based Guqin tablature editing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The whole project framework is shown in Figure 2. The user could edit the tablature on the web editor and the editor
    could render the new score for the user. As for the web editor, it contains three parts, the control interface, the
    typography system, and the customized Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) file generator. The MEI is the underlying file
    format we choose to customize and structurally store the tablature music and it will be decoded for the Typography
    System to generate the tablature. Then it will be delivered to the control interface to wait for editing. When the
    user edits the score, the changes will go back down the flow and reflect the changes in MEI. Also, we will provide a
    server that can store the score and let the editor retrieve the scores. The main challenges and mission of the
    project are: customizing the Guqin tablature in MEI file, visualizing Guqin tablature characters in typography
    system, and developing the web editor application.

    Guqin tablature is called "Jianzi Pu (减字谱)", which uses the radicals of Chinese characters, called Jianzi, to
    represent the corresponding gestures. Each "Puzi (谱字)", a basic unit of Jianzi Pu, contains at least left-hand
    gesture, right-hand gesture, string number, and string position, as shown in Figure 3. Up to now, no music format
    supports this kind of notation, but MEI provides us a chance to realize it.

  <p>
    MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) (Music Encoding Initiative 2022) is a community-driven, open-source effort to define
    a system for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure. It is based on eXtensible Markup Language
    (XML) schema and supports several notation systems, including common Western music notation (CWMN), mensural
    notation, neume notation. The main advantage of MEI is that it allows developers to customize new notation using ODD
    (One Document Does-it-all), a part of the TEI standard. As for tablature notation, some researchers have already
    done some research on customizing guitar and lute tablature in the MEI file (de Valk et al. 2020). Learning from
    their experience, our workflow of this part will be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Identify notational features specific to Guqin tablatures, such as gestures of two hands;</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Figure out the requirements and make sure existing MEI elements and attributes are reused when appropriate;</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Propose the module and ensure that the proposed module fits the MEI approach.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In this way, we will develop a customized MEI module for Guqin tablature notation. Also, we joined the MEI tablature
    interesting group where we could receive the latest MEI tablature news.
  </p>
  <h3 id="visualize-guqin-tablature-characters-in-typography-system">
    Visualize Guqin tablature characters in typography system
  </h3>
  <p>
    As for Guqin tablature visualization, there are two challenges. The first is organizing text direction. Unlike the
    common western musical notation, the Guqin tablature displays vertically and starts from the right side of the page
    to the left. To implement this in the web, we decide to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a language for describing
    the style of rendered HTML web page on the screen, to facilitate the vertical and right-to-left organization of
    Guqin symbols (CSS Working Group 2017; W3C 2019).
  </p>
  <p>
    The second challenge is to create a jianzi musical notation by customizing a font file with a ligature feature. As
    shown in Figure 3, each Puzi consists of several Jianzi characters. However, up to now, the Unicode standard has not
    included Jianzi, so these characters cannot be directly displayed on computers. Therefore, we decide to customize a
    font with Guqin symbols as the special "private-use characters" in Unicode (2014). Some Guqin amateurs have already
    tried to customize the Jianzi font which could be used as a reference<a
      href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"
      ><sup>1</sup></a
    >. In the meantime, displaying Puzi requires the ligature feature of the font. Ligature in typography means two or
    more letters or symbols are joined into one single symbol, shown in figure 4. We decide to use The OpenType font
    format, which supports the ligature feature, to render jianzi.

  <h3 id="develop-the-web-editor-application">Develop the web editor application</h3>
  <p>
    The outer layer of the project is a web-based editor application. Previous to our project, researchers in DDMAL have
    already developed a web-based online and open-source neume notation editor, Neon.js. It is also based on the MEI
    file and the editing changes of the score can reflect in the MEI file (Burlet et al. 2012). This project has
    improved to Neon2 which uses Verovio as a Javascript toolkit to reduce the latency (Regimbal et al. 2019). Our group
    will follow the experience from the Neon project to develop ours. Our editor is decided to enable users to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>View, create, and edit Guqin score;</li>
    <li>Type jianzi easily from a normal keyboard;</li>
    <li>Export score to MEI and PDF file;</li>
    <li>Translate a customized MEI file to its corresponding Guqin score;</li>
    <li>Upload/download scores to/from the website.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To implement these features, a client-server design pattern will be used. The client (front-end) side aims to
    provide the interface to the user, while the server (back-end) side aims to store the data and send the data to the
    client. For the front-end service, we'll use React<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"
      ><sup>2</sup></a
    >, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, to handle user operations and provide feedback. For the
    back-end service, we'll use a database server (e.g., PostgreSQL<a
      href="#fn3"
      class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"
      ><sup>3</sup></a
    >, MongoDB<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a
    >, and redis<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a
    >) to store MEI scores and send data to the front-end. The front-end and back-end are interact with an interface
    called representational state transfer application programming interface (RESTful API).

  <h3 id="future-application">Future Application</h3>
  <p>
    In the future, our website could be extended to an editor platform for more gesture-based tablature notation, such
    as Shakuhachi notation and some new notations for DMIs. It can also be prepared for future tablature OMR correction
    use. Also, it could provide a platform where the tablature community could compose and share scores. In this way, it
    could contribute to establishing a tablature notation dataset. In the meantime, since the file would be stored in a
    MEI file, the project could connect the whole MEI ecosystem and support conversion to other music notations.
